# DataCamp_projects
In this repository, I will be putting all the DataCamp projects I solve:

## 1st project: Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin
In the notebook, we will automatically detect how closely related Charles Darwin's books are to each other. We will develop the bases of a **content-based book recommendation system**, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are using **NLP**.

## 2nd project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
In the notebook, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and **classify songs** as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms: **Decision trees and logistic regression**

## 3rd project: Do Left-handed People Really Die Young?
This notebook will use pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.


## 4th project:  Draw Flowers Using Mathematics
As the name of the project says, the notebook will use the **ggplot2 library of R** to draw mathematical functions such as sin and cos and form flowers.


## 5th project: A Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets 
A great exemple on **text mining and sentiment analysis with R**. The dataset is from The Trump Twitter Archive by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account from 2009 (the year Trump tweeted for first time) through 2018. We'll filter it for the election period only, June 1, 2015 through November 8, 2016.


## 6th project: Extract Stock Sentiment from News Headlines
In the notebook, we will generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from FINVIZ.com (Web scrapping). Using NLP (NLTK), we can **understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock**.


## 7th project: Na√Øve Bees: Predict Species from Images
In the notebook, we will build a model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images. 
The purpose of this project is to see a real application of **SVM (SVC) in classification** and learn how to preprocess data: images from A to Z (grey scaling, normalizing, flattening... etc) + PCA.


## 8th project: Data Science for Social Good: Crime Study
In the notebook, we will explore San Francisco crime data in order to understand the relationship between civilian-reported incidents of crime and police-reported incidents of crime. Along the way we will use table intersection methods to subset our data, aggregation methods to calculate important statistics, and simple visualizations to understand crime trends with **R**. 


## 9th project: Name Game: Gender Prediction using Sound
Analyze the gender distribution of children's book writers and use sound to match names to gender with Python using **fuzzy name matching.**
The same name can be spelled out in a many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Sound can, therefore, be a better way to match names than spelling. In the project, we will find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books. 


## 10th project: Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data
Wrangle and visualize musical data to find common chords and compare the styles of different artists using **R**
Apply data-wrangling and visualization tools from the tidyverse to musical data. Find the most common chords and chord progressions in a sample of pop/rock music from the 1950s-1990s, and compare the styles of different artists.
We will see the use of standard TidyVerse tools for R, in particular the tibble data structure and the dplyr and ggplot2


## 11th project: ASL Recognition with Deep Learning
In this project, we will train a **convolutional neural network** to **classify** images of ASL letters (A, B, C only). After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we will train a really simple neural network and test its performance.
We will practice the skills from Introduction to Deep Learning in Python and Image Processing with Keras in Python, including building convolutional neural networks to classify images.
