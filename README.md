# DataCamp_projects
In this repository, I will be putting all the DataCamp projects I solve:

## First project: Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin
In the notebook, we will automatically detect how closely related Charles Darwin's books are to each other. We will develop the bases of a **content-based book recommendation system**, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are using **NLP**.

## Second project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
In the notebook, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and **classify songs** as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms: **Decision trees and logistic regression**

## Third project: Do Left-handed People Really Die Young?
This notebook will use pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.


## Forth project:  Draw Flowers Using Mathematics
As the name of the project says, the notebook will use the **ggplot2 library of R** to draw mathematical functions such as sin and cos and form flowers.


## Fifth project: A Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets 
A great exemple on **text mining and sentiment analysis with R**. The dataset is from The Trump Twitter Archive by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account from 2009 (the year Trump tweeted for first time) through 2018. We'll filter it for the election period only, June 1, 2015 through November 8, 2016.
